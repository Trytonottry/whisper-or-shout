# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of **WhisperOrShout**, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or background.

This project is built for the Reddit community — a place of curiosity, creativity, and sometimes glorious chaos. We want to keep it weird, wonderful, and welcoming.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- 🌱 Being kind and respectful to others
- 🗣 Using inclusive language
- 🙌 Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- 🔗 Giving credit where it’s due
- 🧠 Focusing on what is best for the community
- 🤝 Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery
- ❌ Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- ❌ Personal or political attacks
- ❌ Harassment, public or private
- ❌ Publishing others’ private information (e.g., email, phone number)
- ❌ Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the project repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community (e.g., in Discord, Reddit threads, or social media).

We also strongly encourage all participants to follow **Reddit’s Content Policy** and **Community Guidelines**, especially when contributing questions or content that may appear in the app:
👉 [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/content_policy](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/content_policy)

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com) or via a private message on Reddit (u/YourRedditUsername).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, and inspired by Reddit’s community values.
