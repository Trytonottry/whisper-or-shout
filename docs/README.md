# WhisperOrShout 🔊🤫

A social experiment for the [Reddit Fun & Games Hackathon](https://redditfunandgames.devpost.com/) — exploring what people say in private vs. public.

## 🎯 Concept
Every day, users get a **new provocative question**:
> *"What would you do if you could be invisible for one day?"*

They choose:
- **Whisper**: answer anonymously (stored privately)
- **Shout**: post it publicly as a comment

After 24 hours, the community sees:
- % who whispered vs. shouted
- Common themes in whispers
- Funniest public confessions

Sparks discussion, memes, and self-reflection — **the heart of Reddit**.

## 🔄 Daily Refresh
- New question every day (randomized)
- Stats reset daily
- Users can respond once per cycle

## 🧩 Features
